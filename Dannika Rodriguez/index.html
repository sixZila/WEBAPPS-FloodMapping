						<h2>Memoir</h2>
						<p>Memoir is a mobile application which was developed by my team Anamnesia, which consists of Lordd Lazaro, Timothy Rodriguez and me.
						Its main goal is to help users memorize easier with the help of some memorization techniques. These techniques were made into
						mini games to make it more fun, and so that users will easily learn how the technique works.</p>

					<h1>Flood Mapping</h1>
					<p>Flood Mapping is a web application which I developed together with Miguel Collantes, Jamila Sia and Walter Leanzon. It is intended 
					for private vehicle drivers, and is trying to solve the problem whenever there's a typhoon or rain in some parts of 
					the Philippines, because it causes flood which may result to them to get stranded or get their cars damaged. Some features of this web
					application are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Searching for a route which has less floods compared to the other ones.</li>
						<li>Viewing of the places that are flood prone.</li>
						<li>Users Reporting areas that are flooded which allows him to upload a picture to show evidence of how high the flood is.</li>
